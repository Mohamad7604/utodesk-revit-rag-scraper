Click the New link on the Home page. You can change the default templates in the Options dialog, which is accessed from the application menu. Here we will browse to a specific template used for this tutorial.\n\nWhen first starting a project, it's a good idea to establish level datums which provide a framework to start building your model. To see the levels in your project and place new ones, you must first be in an elevation or a section view. In this case, open the South elevation by double-clicking it in the Project Browser.\n\nNotice that 2 levels have been defined for this project. You will want to rename these existing levels to reflect your own project naming scheme.\n\nTo rename a level in the view, you select the level, click its name, and enter a new name. When you rename the levels, you are asked whether you also want to rename the corresponding views - that is, the plan view and the reflected ceiling views associated with this level. Click Yes to automatically change the names of those views in the Project Browser.\n\nAs an alternative to renaming the level in the drawing area, you can right-click the name of the level in the Project Browser and select the Rename option. Again, you are asked about corresponding views and you click Yes. To change the height or position of a level, you can select the associated dimension in the drawing area and enter a new value. The level marker will move to the new position.\n\nTo add a new level, select the Level tool from the Architecture tab of the ribbon. When you use the Line drawing tool, the level will snap into alignment with existing levels in the project. You can also use the temporary dimensions to help you position the level. And if the level is placed in the wrong position, you can always reposition it by editing the dimension or dragging the elevation marker.\n\nTo place the next level, select the Pick Lines tool from the Draw panel. When using this tool, you can select an offset value, to place the level the specified distance away from the line you picked. In this case, you offset the level from the pick line by 500 millimeters. This level only represents a datum for the project, not a building story, so a plan view is not needed, and the option is cleared on the Options bar. Because these 2 levels are very close to each other, click the Add Elbow control on the level line and adjust the position of the level head.\n\nThe 2 new levels are now listed in the Project Browser where you can rename them using the right-click method. The Project Browser sorts the levels by numerical or alphabetical order by default. In this example, the naming scheme begins with a zero and the number to keep levels organized in the Project Browser.", "video_links": ["https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-6419C9CE-F12D-4A6B-9677-949F186D9546", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-5F030511-89D1-4223-B168-CE83343FDE52", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-3B3190C6-94CA-4C44-8EB9-C684A02DBB49", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-F0889711-DC78-47FB-8747-9DC408CBEDA2", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-BD22FE68-5DDC-4E17-8528-AE0BC868A372", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-C7E5CEA9-D741-4829-B39E-73BE40FC4B7E", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-DCA3C942-1284-4FC9-BC06-144DE88C2EFA", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-EDD3FFB6-28D2-40D6-A8F0-D5E6C2807302", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-15BBE1F7-38FD-4AA0-ADA4-CE8923343DC1", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-96F003AD-5559-479F-91F3-263A0E8A7D8A", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-842A4DB6-4CA1-4ECD-9009-962769FFB19C", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-6BFB71DA-BCE6-4623-8ECD-D378E1C9C7F7", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-6573039B-9E1A-45E5-B625-7E02ACC38FF1", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-06AFD15B-1C06-4F7B-9A84-673AD222C2D2", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-267C7626-F0B4-444A-9593-A3FB101C4F21", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-C7FC8EF6-6418-431F-ADC6-493C2E911AFF"], "toc_title": "Video: Create a Project and Add Levels"}

If you are working in a plan view, the associated level is established from that view. For example, you want to add some walls and have them start from the Foundation level, so you will open this view by double-clicking it in the Project Browser.\n\nTo begin placing walls, you select the Wall tool. Once the tool is selected, you can use the Type Selector at the top of the Properties palette to specify the type of wall you want to place, in this example, an exterior wall.\n\nThe height of the wall is specified on the Options Bar. If a level datum already defined in the project is selected, then the top of the wall will be constrained to that level. Here the Lower Parapet is selected for the top constraint of the wall. The height of the wall can also be set to unconnected, in which case you enter an explicit value for the wall height.\n\nThe wall location line is also set on the Options Bar. This setting establishes where the wall will be positioned in relation to the click points as the wall is placed. The exterior finish face will be used for these walls. The Chain option lets you draw connected walls with each mouse click beginning a new segment. The points 1 through 18 are clicked, in order, to place the walls.\n\nWith the exterior walls placed, make modifications to the walls at the corners of the building. Use a containing window to select the walls at the corners. Press CTRL while selecting elements to add more objects to the selection set. On the Properties palette, change the top constraint of the selected walls to the Upper Parapet level. Select the walls at the front right of the building. This is where the entrance of the building will be. On the Properties Palette, set the base offset to 4250 and then on the type selector change the wall type to a wall type created for use at the entry area that does not have the block material on the lower section.\n\nTo create interior walls, you open the Store Floor plan view. Select the Wall tool again and use the Type Selector to specify an interior wall type. The height is set to Lower Parapet and the Location Line of the wall is set to be the wall centerline. While placing interior walls, you might find it useful to change the Chain setting, depending on the condition where you are placing walls.\n\nTo create an opening for the hallway, you use the Split tool and split the wall into 2 separate segments at the point where the opening is needed. Next, you use the Trim tool, selecting the portions of the walls which are to be kept, thus cleaning up the opening for the hallway.", "video_links": ["https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-6419C9CE-F12D-4A6B-9677-949F186D9546", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-5F030511-89D1-4223-B168-CE83343FDE52", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-3B3190C6-94CA-4C44-8EB9-C684A02DBB49", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-F0889711-DC78-47FB-8747-9DC408CBEDA2", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-BD22FE68-5DDC-4E17-8528-AE0BC868A372", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-C7E5CEA9-D741-4829-B39E-73BE40FC4B7E", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-DCA3C942-1284-4FC9-BC06-144DE88C2EFA", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-EDD3FFB6-28D2-40D6-A8F0-D5E6C2807302", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-15BBE1F7-38FD-4AA0-ADA4-CE8923343DC1", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-96F003AD-5559-479F-91F3-263A0E8A7D8A", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-842A4DB6-4CA1-4ECD-9009-962769FFB19C", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-6BFB71DA-BCE6-4623-8ECD-D378E1C9C7F7", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-6573039B-9E1A-45E5-B625-7E02ACC38FF1", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-06AFD15B-1C06-4F7B-9A84-673AD222C2D2", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-267C7626-F0B4-444A-9593-A3FB101C4F21", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-C7FC8EF6-6418-431F-ADC6-493C2E911AFF"], "toc_title": "Video: Create Walls"}

Because visibility may be turned off for the toposolid category in the standard floor plan view, you will want to open a site plan view so the toposolid will be visible once it is created.\n\nLocated on the Site tab of the ribbon, the Toposolid tool is modal, meaning that when the tool is selected, the ribbon displays a contextual tab providing the tools you need to create the toposolid. To exit this mode, you must click either Finish or Cancel. You will create the toposolid by first sketching the boundary of the site. Select the Rectangle tool from the draw panel and sketch a rectangle around the building. Now create a void area for the building. Select Pick Walls from the Draw panel and clear Extend into wall on the Options bar. Hover over one of the exterior walls and press Tab to select the chain of exterior walls. Be sure the sketch is on the interior face of the walls. If it is not, use the flip control to change where the sketch lines are located. On the Type Selector, select Building Terrain toposolid type and click finish.\n\nWith the toposolid still selected, click Add Point on the Shape Editing panel. Set the offset value to 2500 and place points representing this elevation on the site. Change the elevation to 1000 and add more points. Now click Modify Sub Elements to change the elevation of a boundary. Select the right boundary of the site, use the in canvas control to set the boundary edge to -500. Click Modify to complete the toposolid. A toposolid can also be created from imported CAD files that include 3D contour information, or from a points file which can be generated by certain civil design applications.\n\nNow create fill and add a floor to the model. First, create another toposolid for the fill beneath the floor. On the ribbon, click Toposolid. Select Pick Walls from the Draw panel and clear Extend into wall on the Options bar. Hover over one of the exterior walls and press Tab to select the chain of exterior walls. Again, be sure the sketch is on the interior face of the walls. If it is not, use the flip control to change where the sketch lines are located. On the Type Selector, select Pad Fill toposolid type and set the Height Offset From Level parameter to -150, then click finish.\n\nAdd a floor to the model using a similar technique as the toposolid. On the Architecture tab select Floor. Select Pick Walls from the Draw panel and clear Extend into wall on the Options bar. Hover over one of the exterior walls and press Tab to select the chain of exterior walls. If the sketch lines are on the interior face of the walls, click finish.\n\nThe toposolid can be seen in a 3D view. Finally, on the View Control Bar, you can apply a shaded or realistic visual style to the view to get an idea of what the building will look like.", "video_links": ["https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-6419C9CE-F12D-4A6B-9677-949F186D9546", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-5F030511-89D1-4223-B168-CE83343FDE52", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-3B3190C6-94CA-4C44-8EB9-C684A02DBB49", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-F0889711-DC78-47FB-8747-9DC408CBEDA2", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-BD22FE68-5DDC-4E17-8528-AE0BC868A372", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-C7E5CEA9-D741-4829-B39E-73BE40FC4B7E", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-DCA3C942-1284-4FC9-BC06-144DE88C2EFA", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-EDD3FFB6-28D2-40D6-A8F0-D5E6C2807302", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-15BBE1F7-38FD-4AA0-ADA4-CE8923343DC1", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-96F003AD-5559-479F-91F3-263A0E8A7D8A", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-842A4DB6-4CA1-4ECD-9009-962769FFB19C", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-6BFB71DA-BCE6-4623-8ECD-D378E1C9C7F7", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-6573039B-9E1A-45E5-B625-7E02ACC38FF1", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-06AFD15B-1C06-4F7B-9A84-673AD222C2D2", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-267C7626-F0B4-444A-9593-A3FB101C4F21", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-C7FC8EF6-6418-431F-ADC6-493C2E911AFF"], "toc_title": "Video: Create Terrain and Building Pad"}

To place a floor on the mezzanine level of the model, double-click the mezzanine floor plan in the Project Browser.\n\nFloors are sketch based elements. Selecting the Floor tool opens a sketch mode in which the perimeter of the floor is sketched with a closed loop of lines. In this example, some walls placed in the model will be used to define the shape of the floor. The Pick Walls tool from the Draw panel can be used to help sketch the floor perimeter. Using this tool also creates a constraint between the floor edge and the wall. If a wall is moved to accommodate a design change, the floor will also automatically move with it.\n\nClick each wall to use it as the basis for the sketch boundary. The parallel lines shown near the sketch line of the floor indicate the span direction of the floor. In this case, the floor is a generic floor, so the span direction is not critical. If the span direction needs to be changed, the Span Direction tool on the Draw panel allows for another line of the perimeter to be assigned the span direction.\n\nThe line segment tool is selected to sketch additional lines to define the sketch of the floor boundary.

In the Type Selector, choose the window family and the type you want to place. In this case, a fixed window sized 610 x 1220 mm is selected. Position the cursor near the wall of the office to place the window. Temporary dimensions may also be used to help in positioning the windows. Three windows are added to the wall between the break room and the store room, and 4 more windows are added to the exterior wall of the break room.\n\nSometimes a family that has been loaded into the project may be very close to what is needed, but is not an exact match.

In this case, a new family type can be created from the existing family.\n\nSelect one of the windows in the model and then click Edit Type on the Properties palette to open the Type Properties dialog for this window family. To create a new window type of a different size, the current type is duplicated and renamed. Then the type parameters related to the window size are changed to meet the design requirements.\n\nNow the other windows we placed are selected, and its size changed using the Type Selector to select the new window type that we just created.\n\nUse dimensions to help you position windows after they are placed. After the windows are approximately placed, a string of aligned dimensions is added. Click the EQ symbol on the dimension string to create an equality constraint on the elements.

Select the line segment tool from the Draw panel. Now add embedded curtain walls as storefront windows. On the Properties palette, set the Base Offset to 500 mm and the Unconnected Height to 2000 mm. Now place the curtain walls directly on top of the existing exterior walls using the reference planes as guides for positioning. You can see in the 3D view, the curtain walls have cut a holes for themselves in the exterior wall.\n\nThe grid pattern of a curtain wall is a type parameter. We want a horizontal mullion in the embedded curtain walls that aligns with the reveal on the exterior wall. Select one of the embedded curtain walls and click Edit Type. In the Type Properties dialog, first duplicate the type and give the new type a name. Now change the spacing for the horizontal grid to 1200 mm. Then the other embedded curtain walls are changed to use the new type.\n\nDoors are not placed in curtain walls in the same way doors are placed into basic walls.

When you use this tool to draw stair runs, the lines for the boundary and the risers are automatically generated.\n\nOn the Options bar, set the justification of the stair related to the sketched line. Here we select Run : Left because we will be defining the left edge of the stair. After you click the starting point, a rectangle displays, representing the extents of the stair run. As you move the cursor along the run, the display continuously updates to show the number of risers created and the number of risers remaining. Once you move the cursor beyond the extent of the rectangle and click to specify the endpoint, all of the calculated risers are created. Click the Finish Edit Mode tool to create the stair run.\n\nRailings are automatically generated and attached to the stair. We need to add a railing to the Mezzanine level, so the Mezzanine floor plan is opened from the Project Browser. Additional railings can be added using the Railing tool.\n\nUse the Pick Lines tool on the Draw panel, along with an offset value you specify on the Options Bar. The railing type is selected from the type selector on the Properties palette. The Offset tool allows you to use the edges of the floor as a layout guide for the railing sketch.\n\nThe results of the sketched railings can be seen in the 3D view of the model. Select the flat roof and use Temporary Hide/Isolate on the View Control Bar to temporarily hide the roof so you can see the railings. Select the railing on the stair along the wall and use the Type Selector to change it to a wall mounted rail. Then select the other railing on the stair and change the type to match the railing on the mezzanine.", "video_links": ["https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-6419C9CE-F12D-4A6B-9677-949F186D9546", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-5F030511-89D1-4223-B168-CE83343FDE52", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-3B3190C6-94CA-4C44-8EB9-C684A02DBB49", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-F0889711-DC78-47FB-8747-9DC408CBEDA2", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-BD22FE68-5DDC-4E17-8528-AE0BC868A372", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-C7E5CEA9-D741-4829-B39E-73BE40FC4B7E", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-DCA3C942-1284-4FC9-BC06-144DE88C2EFA", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-EDD3FFB6-28D2-40D6-A8F0-D5E6C2807302", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-15BBE1F7-38FD-4AA0-ADA4-CE8923343DC1", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-96F003AD-5559-479F-91F3-263A0E8A7D8A", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-842A4DB6-4CA1-4ECD-9009-962769FFB19C", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-6BFB71DA-BCE6-4623-8ECD-D378E1C9C7F7", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-6573039B-9E1A-45E5-B625-7E02ACC38FF1", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-06AFD15B-1C06-4F7B-9A84-673AD222C2D2", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-267C7626-F0B4-444A-9593-A3FB101C4F21", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-C7FC8EF6-6418-431F-ADC6-493C2E911AFF"], "toc_title": "Video: Create Stairs and Railings"}

You can also open a recently used file by clicking the project. The user interface provides all of the tools you need to work in a model.\n\nThe Project Browser organizes the views, schedules, and sheets of the current project. To display a different view, expand a group, and double-click the view title. Display the model in a single view, or open several views, and click Tile on the View tab to see the views at the same time.\n\nWhen you select an element in the drawing, you can modify its properties on the Properties palette. For example, use the Type Selector to change the door type from single to double, and that change is reflected in all of the views. Use view controls in the drawing area to manipulate the model and see your changes.\n\nThe tools you need to design the building model are grouped by task on the ribbon. When an element is selected, object-specific tools are available on a contextual tab. You can customize the Quick Access toolbar to display the tools that you use most often. For example, right-click a tool, and click Add to Quick Access toolbar.\n\nThe View Control Bar provides options for changing the view display, such as the scale or visual style.\n\nTo save changes, use the File tab on the ribbon, where file-related tasks are located.\n\nThe user interface is designed to simplify your workflow, and with a few clicks, you can customize the interface to support the way that you work.", "video_links": ["https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-6419C9CE-F12D-4A6B-9677-949F186D9546", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-C7FC8EF6-6418-431F-ADC6-493C2E911AFF", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-DFFA6A87-82BD-46D2-B9FE-0E13C21624F3", "https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-553A2A75-0962-441C-B31B-7EFBF35D5D2D"], "toc_title": "User Interface"}
